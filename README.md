# WolfMQTT

This is an implementation of the MQTT Client written in C for embedded use, which supports SSL/TLS via the wolfSSL library. This library was built from the ground up to be multi-platform, space conscience and extensible. Integrates with wolfSSL to provide TLS support.

## Architecture

The library has three components.

### 1. mqtt_client

This is where the top level application interfaces for the MQTT client reside.

* `int MqttClient_Init(MqttClient *client, MqttNet *net, MqttMsgCb msg_cb, byte *tx_buf, int tx_buf_len, byte *rx_buf, int rx_buf_len, int cmd_timeout_ms);`

These API's are blocking on `MqttNet.read` until error/timeout (`cmd_timeout_ms`):

* `int MqttClient_Connect(MqttClient *client, MqttConnect *connect);`
* `int MqttClient_Publish(MqttClient *client, MqttPublish *publish);`
* `int MqttClient_Subscribe(MqttClient *client, MqttSubscribe *subscribe);`
* `int MqttClient_Unsubscribe(MqttClient *client, MqttUnsubscribe *unsubscribe);`
* `int MqttClient_Ping(MqttClient *client);`
* `int MqttClient_Disconnect(MqttClient *client);`

This function blocks waiting for a new publish message to arrive for a maximum duration of `timeout_ms`.

* `int MqttClient_WaitMessage(MqttClient *client, MqttMessage *message, int timeout_ms);`

These are the network connect / disconnect interfaces that wrap the MqttNet callbacks and handle WolfSSL TLS:

* `int MqttClient_NetConnect(MqttClient *client, const char* host, word16 port, int timeout_ms, int use_tls, MqttTlsCb cb);`
* `int MqttClient_NetDisconnect(MqttClient *client);`

Helper functions:

* `const char* MqttClient_ReturnCodeToString(int return_code);`

### 2. mqtt_packet

This is where all the packet encoding/decoding is handled.

The header contains the MQTT Packet structures for:

* Connect: `MqttConnect`
* Publish / Message: `MqttPublish` / `MqttMessage` (they are the same)
* Subscribe: `MqttSubscribe`
* Unsubscribe: `MqttUnsubscribe`


### 3. mqtt_socket

This is where the transport socket optionally wraps TLS and uses the `MqttNet` callbacks for the platform specific network handling.

The header contains the MQTT Network structure `MqttNet` for network callback and context.

## Implementation

Here are the steps for creating your own implementation.

1. Create network callback functions for Connect, Read, Write and Disconnect. See `examples/mqttnet.c` and `examples/mqttnet.h`.
2. Define the callback functions and context in a `MqttNet` structure.
3. Call `MqttClient_Init` passing in a `MqttClient` structure pointer, `MqttNet` structure pointer, `MqttMsgCb` function pointer, TX/RX buffers with maximum length and command timeout.
4. Call `MqttClient_NetConnect` to connect to broker over network. If `use_tls` is non-zero value then it will perform a TLS connection. The TLS callback `MqttTlsCb` should be defined for wolfSSL certificate configuration.
5. Call `MqttClient_Connect` passing pointer to `MqttConnect` structure to send MQTT connect command and wait for Connect Ack.
6. Call `MqttClient_Subscribe` passing pointer to `MqttSubscribe` structure to send MQTT Subscribe command and wait for Subscribe Ack (depending on QoS level).
7. Call `MqttClient_WaitMessage` passing pointer to `MqttMessage` to wait for incoming MQTT Publish message.

## Release Notes

### v0.4 (12/30/2015)
* Fixed bug with subscribe not populating acknowledgment return code(s) properly.
* Fixed build error if using wolfSSL 3.7.1 or older due to missing signature.c/.h wrappers. This fix disables the firmware examples if the wolfSSL version isn't greater than 3.7.1.
* Fix to ensure `topic_name` pointer is reset when publish callback message is not new `msg_new = 0`.
* Fixes to suppress possible warning "Value stored to [] is never read".
* Fixed firmware example to trap case where file isn't found.
* Fixed possible ./autogen.sh error with missing "config.rpath".
* Fixed Windows issue with SetConsoleCtrlHandler incorrectly reporting error.
* Fixed issue with Visual Studio 2015 wolfssl.lib reference.
* Fixed build errors with G++ (./configure CC=g++).
* Fixed "FirmwareHeader" to use WOLFMQTT_PACK macro. 
* Added helper macro's and comments for topic names/filters.
* Added TLS certification verification reference implementation to examples.
* Updated the topic names in examples to use "wolfMQTT/example/".
* Added QoS level to example console output.
* Added memset to initialize some of the example stack variables.
* Removed the LWT from the firmware examples.
* Added retain flag "-r" option on the "fwpush" example.
* Updated the examples to use macros for all memory and string functions, so they are more portable.
* Added Visual Studio projects for "fwpush" and "fwclient".

### v0.3 (11/18/2015)
* Fixes bug with first byte of payload being null'd if QoS level was 0.
* Fixed issue with stdint types (uint#_t) being used.
* Fixes for remaining length encoding/decoding for large packets.
* Added support for large payloads using new message callback flags `msg_done` and `msg_new` along with MqttMessage `buffer_pos` and `buffer_len`.
* Added example for secure firmware upgrade. Uses the MQTT client library to push a signed payload `fwpush` to a broker, then uses another client `fwclient` to receive the signed payload and verify its signature using a provided public key.

### v0.2 (11/06/2015)
* Fixes to handle receival of publish and QoS messages while performing packet writes/waits.
* Added support / tested with Windows.
* Added Visual Studio 2015 solution and projects.
* Added support / tested with FreeRTOS and Lwip.
* Fixes for compiler warnings.

### v0.1 (10/26/15)
* Initial release with support for MQTT v3.1.1, QoS 0-2, TLS and example client.
